# My First HTML5 Game
============================


This isn't anything special and won't be updated again, though I may make future HTML5 games similar to this.

I just went through the tutorial located at:
http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/html-css-techniques/build-your-first-game-with-html5/

In order to create this basic game. I am interested in altering and extending it, though, to create even more. But I'm going to use another version of Box2D that is more condensed instead of this one.


This repository is virtually identical to:
https://github.com/andferminiano/html5-adventuregamedemo

But I did make some of my own customizations. I downloaded the source code from the above repository, deleted the contents of box2dutils.js and game.js, then followed through the tutorial myself to finish it off.
